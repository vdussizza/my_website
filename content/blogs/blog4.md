Outside of work and university life, I dedicate a lot of time to food! I enjoy both cooking as well as trying new (and old) restaurants wherever I am. My favourite restaurant in London is probably a stall in Waterloo called Otsumami Cafe which specialises in Katsudon. I especially enjoy eating/cooking Asian food and my favourite dish is either xiao long bao or pav bhaji - I'll have to try more before I can decide. In the past I've also taken professional level pizza and cheese making courses.

Beyond food, I'm a big Formula 1 fan and I try my best to watch all the grands prix. My favourite driver is Daniel Ricciardo but I'm extremely excited to see how the younger drivers, including George Russell and Lando Norris, develop.
