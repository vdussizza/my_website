I was born in India to and Indian mother and Italian father. Since I was born, I've visited grandparents in opposite sides of the world with very different cultures. From India, I moved around the world to countries including Italy, UK, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, Romania, and China. I've therefore witnessed some very different cultures. Particularly memorable is the first time I saw scorpions on a stick being sold by the side of the road in Myanmar.
